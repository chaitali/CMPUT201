DOES THE FOLLOWING:

Reads in the first token of each line in an input file and prints the number of occurences of each key token. The eight keywords are as follows: Image, lineTo, End, print, draw, translate, child, #. 

Compile by typing make. 

Run by typing:
	 ./draw1a ./inputfile.1
where input_file.1 is any text file with valid input for draw1a. 

I did not collaborate with anyone.
