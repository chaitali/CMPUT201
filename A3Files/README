DOES THE FOLLOWING:

The program will read in an input file for the landscape coordinates and
implements a lunar lander game, where the left and right arrows will 
rotate the lander counter-clockwise and clockwise respectively, and 
the space bar will activate the lander's thrust. The lander will land 
safely if the velocity is less than 15, the lander has an angle of 90 degrees 
and lands on a flat surface. 

Compile by typing make. 

Run by typing:
	./lander -g # -t # -f landscapefile.txt

To get added improvements add a -i. 

The improvements to this game are:

1. The ability for the lander to wrap around the edges of the screen. 
2. The crash landing of the lander
3. Adding a fuel bar to the game
